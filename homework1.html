I've been switching back and forth with career paths from computer science to health science and back to computer science. By taking this class, I'm hoping to strengthen my skill set in web development especially in the design department. I have some web development knowledge, using online resources such as Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, and youtube where I learned HTML, CSS, javascript, and reactJS. Here at IVC, I've taking python, C programming, Java and currently taking C++ and visual basic programming. The one wearing the number 13 jersey is me</p>
